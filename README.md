### **Collaborative AI-Powered Fraud Detection and Reporting Platform**

A platform designed to help users and organizations identify and prevent scams using AI and community-driven reporting.

---

### **Core Features (MVP)**

**1. Spam Screenshot Detection (OCR + AI)**
âœ… Users upload screenshots of suspicious messages.  
âœ… Google Vision API (OCR) extracts text.  
âœ… Google Gemini AI / Vertex AI analyzes message for fraud patterns.  
âœ… AI assigns a Spam Score (0-100%) with an explanation.  

 **2. Collaborative Spam Reporting**
âœ… Users & verified organizations report new scams (text, URLs, call scripts).  
âœ… Stored in a public spam database (Supabase/PostgreSQL).  
âœ… AI learns from new reports and adapts fraud detection.  

**3. AI Model Updates with Community Input**
âœ… AI analyzes newly reported scams and refines detection rules.  
âœ… Uses Google Vertex AI AutoML to retrain model over time.  
âœ… Spam detection improves as database grows.  

**4. Scam Awareness Hub**
âœ… Publicly accessible list of latest scams (trending frauds, patterns, etc.).  
âœ… Verified users (Govt/Companies) can tag scams as Critical.  
âœ… AI-generated scam summaries using Google Gemini AI.

### **Data Flow**

1. User uploads a screenshot â†’ OCR extracts text.  
2. Text is analyzed by AI (Google Gemini + Vertex AI via FastAPI).  
3. Fraud Score & Explanation is returned.  
4. Users/Govt can report new scams (stored in MongoDB & used for AI retraining).  
5. AI model updates dynamically with new scam patterns over time.
